# Avocodo: Generative Adversarial Network for Artifact-free Vocoder [Coming Soon]

Unofficial implementation of [Avocodo: Generative Adversarial Network for Artifact-free Vocoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13404) .

## Notes:
* Avocodo uses same Generator as HiFi-GAN V1 and V2 but using different discriminators for modelling better lower and higher frequencies.
* PQMF is the crucial for both Discriminators.
